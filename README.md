Awareness is the first key step in progress. In order to gain awareness, one must be influenced by internal thoughts or be exposed to some stimulant in one's environment. The environment can be the people around you, the websites you frequent, or anything that is external to you. Quiet Time is an app that focuses on serving you quotes from thought leaders with the goal to have you become aware of the meaning of these quotes. The ultimate goal is to reset your mind and focus on these quotes to order to prompt you to be better in any way that you define progress. Quiet Time focuses on creating a unique experience that allows the users to be drawn in and to focus on the daily quote.
